I, al debaran, have endured many adventures in my life, but I really thought it was all prettymuch random. That the universe were deterministic never really occured to me. 

I love to throw the toy with the dog! When I throw with my left hand, I try to follow through with extension. Sometimes I repeat with the undef hand. You never know when the toy will take a big bounce, so I keep it low. It went south to the fence. Then my pretty pitty retrieved it at a gallop.
.7 of the time I go to the gym. I perform stretching for my health.
